2119453008|00000000||Come here.
2119453010|00000000||I sent my soldiers to patrol the forest east of Ursten.

2119453031|00000000||Why you asking me?
2119453033|00000000||Hum... I will have a look.
2119453035|00000000||The Redanian army is asking you.
2119453037|00000000||That should be enough.
2119453039|00000000||Money…
2119453041|00000000||You'll be well paid if you unravel this mystery.
2119453043|00000000||I can't imagine asking my superior for help because I've lost my troops.
2119453045|00000000||You have a reputation for not being very talkative, so…
2119453047|00000000||You find my boys, I pay you, and everyone's happy!
2119453049|00000000||That's all you witchers ever talk about.

2119453116|00000000||Skin's unnaturally pale. No injuries. Hm...
2119453119|00000000||Redanian soldier. Looks like he suffocated. Horrible way to die.

2119453178|00000000||Something happened, definitely, before they could attack.
2119453180|00000000||Hmm, maybe… They were poisoned? In what way?

2119453245|00000000||Where am I?
2119453247|00000000||This icy river is really slippery.
2119453249|00000000||I should explore the surroundings.
2119453251|00000000||Where am I?
2119453254|00000000||Nothing really interesting here.
2119453256|00000000||I should continue to follow this valley.
2119453257|00000000||Explore the surroundings.
2119453259|00000000||This icy river is really slippery.
2119453261|00000000||Interesting these ice skates.
2119453263|00000000||And... there's like a mushroom smell on this loot.
2119453265|00000000||Even if it's less strong, this odour reminds me the fog's one that has paralyzed the witcher.
2119453267|00000000||I should follow it.
2119453269|00000000||Bear's odour covers that of mushrooms.
2119453270|00000000||Follow mushrooms' odour.
2119453271|00000000||Find back mushrooms' odour.
2119453272|00000000||Inspect elves' loot.
2119453274|00000000||Given the size of this frozen lake, these ice skates will come in handy.

2119453282|00000000||I don't need this anymore.
2119453284|00000000||A dead end. Yet there must be a passage.
2119453286|00000000||This wall is an illusion. I should be able to pass through it.
2119453287|00000000||Find a way inside.
2119453288|00000000||Follow mushroom odour.
2119453290|00000000||Head to the west coast.
2119453292|00000000||What do you want?
2119453294|00000000||I need help.
2119453296|00000000||I sent my soldiers to patrol the forest east of Ursten.
2119453298|00000000||I haven't had any news for several days.
2119453300|00000000||Filling out contracts, that's what you witchers do for a living.
2119453302|00000000||If it's well paid.
2119453304|00000000||Why you asking me?
2119453306|00000000||Sorry. Not interested.
2119453308|00000000||Need to talk about how much I'll get paid, first.
2119453310|00000000||The Redanian army is asking you.
2119453312|00000000||That should be enough.
2119453314|00000000||Money…
2119453316|00000000||That's all you witchers ever talk about.
2119453318|00000000||You'll be well paid if you unravel this mystery.

2119453322|00000000||I can't imagine asking my superior for help because I've lost my troops.

2119453328|00000000||Mhm. Guess I gotta investigate…
2119453330|00000000||Perfect! Come and find me when you've cleared up this mess.
2119453332|00000000||Not interested. Farewell.

2119453342|00000000||I don't need this anymore.
2119453347|00000000||No time for walking. I need to hurry up.
2119453349|00000000||I shouldn't go there. I need to get to the Coast of Wrecks as soon as possible.
2119453351|00000000||It must be a wrong direction. I need to get to the coast.
2119453353|00000000||Is the coast this way? I need to hurry up.
2119453355|00000000||Hmm... It seems I should go the other way.
2119453357|00000000||Kill white bears.
2119453359|00000000||The odour comes from this...
2119453362|00000000||Well, well... There's a reason I spent so much time on the gravity trap.
2119453364|00000000||So I'm a prisoner now.
2119453366|00000000||The young-looking elven mage/sorceress tells him that he has been developing such weapon for a long time, which will change the course of decision in battles, even with the numerical superiority of the enemy. He is not Aen Saevherne, but Francesca herself taught him a bit. After several years of tedious work, he was able to obtain a particularly toxic mixture by mixing white-hot phosphorus crystals and Ergot seeds. He says that the witcher is very suitable for him to experiment.

2119453372|00000000||I have a long way to go. Need to saddle Crucian.
2119453374|00000000||It seems I'm there.
2119453376|00000000||Insightful. Promising…
2119453378|00000000||Who are you and what do you want?
2119453380|00000000||Who are you and what do you want?
2119453382|00000000||Set me free, you elf bastard!
2119453384|00000000||Who are you and what do you want?
2119453386|00000000||Set me free, you elven bastard!
2119453388|00000000||And he's polite.
2119453390|00000000||But he's rude.
2119453392|00000000||It's of little interest, considering what lies ahead, but I'll answer your questions.
2119453394|00000000||My name is Emilia.
2119453396|00000000||Great elf witch.
2119453398|00000000||Lower your insignificant tone, lab rat.
2119453400|00000000||My name is Emilia.
2119453402|00000000||Great sorceress of Aen Seidhe.
2119453404|00000000||And maybe then I'll tell you what awaits you.
2119453406|00000000||I was trained by Francesca Findabair, our Daisy of the Valleys. But now I'm improving myself in alchemy arts.
2119453408|00000000||You see, I'm applying what I've learned to develop a substance that will enable elves to regain their rightful place.
2119453410|00000000||After several years of tedious work, I was able to obtain a particularly mixture by mixing white-hot phosphorus crystals with ergot seeds.
2119453412|00000000||However it's still not always mortal, and I need more subjects for experiments.
2119453414|00000000||And that's where you come in, vatt'ghern. You are a godsend.
2119453416|00000000||From what I've heard, witchers have a particular metabolism that I think will be very suitable for my experiments.
2119453418|00000000||We will start with small doses to find out how your body copes with the poison, and I'll find a counter to it.
2119453420|00000000||I've always been a supporter of the elves.
2119453422|00000000||I always remain neutral about elves.
2119453424|00000000||I hate elves.
2119453426|00000000||This is a mistake, I always remain neutral about elves.
2119453428|00000000||If you're not with us, you're against us.
2119453430|00000000||This is a mistake, I've always been a supporter of the elves.
2119453432|00000000||And I'm here to help another witcher named Geralt of Rivia.
2119453434|00000000||He's been paralyzed from the attack of your henchmen, and won't survive long unless I bring back the ingredients to make an antidote.
2119453436|00000000||So you are telling truth. If the witchers continue to side with us, it will be more useful than a dissection on my table.
2119453438|00000000||I shall let you go.
2119453440|00000000||Hurts to say this, but I have to find another body for my experiments.
2119453442|00000000||But first, you have to sign this sort of non-disclosure agreement with your blood.
2119453444|00000000||To make me sure you will never divulge what I'm up to here.
2119453446|00000000||You say you're here to help Geralt of Rivia, but he's no friend of Aen Seidhe.
2119453448|00000000||And the friends of my enemies are my enemies.
2119453450|00000000||Don't get bored, I'll be back soon to test the new version of poison on you.
2119453452|00000000||I'm gonna kill you!
2119453454|00000000||Poor thing, sharp sword and stupid muscles won't help you. This cage could hold even a bear.
2119453456|00000000||You didn't tie my hands.
2119453458|00000000||You just called me an elven whore.
2119453460|00000000||You can't be a friend of Aen Seidhe.
2119453462|00000000||Gwynbleidd has helped Vernossiel.
2119453464|00000000||Gwynbleidd has helped Iorveth.
2119453466|00000000||Hate you all. I hope Dol Blatanna will die out completely soon.
2119453468|00000000||That's not gonna happen. And for your filthy words, I'll cut out your tongue.
2119453470|00000000||She underestimates witcher signs. Aard will help me get this door out.
2119453471|00000000||Use the portal to return in Novigrad.
2119453472|00000000||Use Aard to break the cage door.
2119453473|00000000||Find any ingredients of the venom.
2119453474|00000000||Defeat the golem.
2119453475|00000000||Defeat Emilia.
2119453476|00000000||Loot Emilia's body.
2119453477|00000000||Use crystal to activate the portal.
2119453478|00000000||Leave the laboratory.
2119453480|00000000||I shouldn't go there. I have to explore the coast.
2119453482|00000000||I should return to the coast. Some traces must be there.
2119453484|00000000||Very well, you signed the oath.
2119453486|00000000||Here's the antidote for one person, but it was made for an elf. I can't promise if it will help a witcher.
2119453488|00000000||I've activated the portal near the lab exit, use it to get back.
2119453490|00000000||What're you doing here, vagrant?!
2119453492|00000000||No pass, no passage!
2119453494|00000000||What kind of pass?
2119453496|00000000||Get him out!
2119453502|00000000||What do you want?
2119453504|00000000||I need help.
2119453506|00000000||I sent my soldiers to patrol the forest east of Ursten.
2119453508|00000000||I haven't had any news for several days.
2119453510|00000000||Filling out contracts, that's what you witchers do for a living.
2119453512|00000000||If it's well paid.
2119453514|00000000||Why you asking me?
2119453516|00000000||Sorry. Not interested.
2119453518|00000000||Need to talk about how much I'll get paid, first.
2119453520|00000000||The Redanian army is asking you.
2119453522|00000000||That should be enough.
2119453524|00000000||Money…
2119453526|00000000||That's all you witchers ever talk about.
2119453528|00000000||You'll be well paid if you unravel this mystery.
2119453530|00000000||Why're you asking me?
2119453532|00000000||I can't imagine asking my superior for help because I've lost my troops.
2119453534|00000000||You have a reputation for not being very talkative, so…
2119453536|00000000||You find my boys, I pay you, and everyone's happy!
2119453538|00000000||Mhm. Guess I gotta investigate…
2119453540|00000000||Perfect! Come and find me when you've cleared up this mess.
2119453542|00000000||Not interested. Farewell.
2119453546|00000000||It was you who gave the contract to the witcher Geralt of Rivia?
2119453548|00000000||It depends... what do you want from me?
2119453550|00000000||I'm here for the reward.
2119453552|00000000||What do you mean?
2119453554|00000000||Your soldiers died in a Scoia'tael ambush.
2119453556|00000000||Damn elves.
2119453558|00000000||I saw the elves attack the witcher.
2119453560|00000000||He's in bad shape, but he'll survive.
2119453562|00000000||I've come to claim the reward, since you're interested in knowing what happened to your troops, not in who brought you the information.

2119453746|00000000||It's possible.
2119453748|00000000||Then don't count on it.
2119453750|00000000||Another witcher has already come and told me what I was interested in.
2119453760|00000000||Good, because you wouldn't have had anything.
2119453762|00000000||Another witcher has already come and told me what I was interested in.
2119453764|00000000||By the way, if you're interested in hearing from him...
2119453766|00000000||He literally burst into flames in front of me.
2119453768|00000000||He must have upset someone he shouldn't have.
2119453770|00000000||Now get out of my sight.
2119453772|00000000||He took the reward and left.
2119453774|00000000||And I have a feeling we won't be seeing him again any time soon.
2119453776|00000000||Elves again...
2119453778|00000000||So... Maybe I can find out where are they came from?
2119453780|00000000||The tracks end here. What now?
2119453782|00000000||Probably the Scoia'tael have done this. Poor thing.
2119453784|00000000||Hmmm... Some kind of pass. I'll deal with it later.
2119453785|00000000||Deal with Scoia'tael.
2119453786|00000000||Search for traces.
2119453789|00000000||removed
2119453790|00000000||removed
2119453793|00000000||Maybe we could make a deal?
2119453795|00000000||Open the cage. Now.
2119453797|00000000||In a few moments you will die by my sword.
2119453800|00000000||I have quite a few orens. Take them, just let me go.
2119453802|00000000||It's too late to bargain, you fool. I'll take your money anyway.
2119453804|00000000||Open the cage. Now.
2119453806|00000000||You're ridiculous. These little tricks are nothing compared to real magic.
2119453808|00000000||All right.
2119453811|00000000||Oh...
2119453813|00000000||Use crystal to activate the teleport.
2119453814|00000000||Explore the coast.
2119453816|00000000||You... Managed to escape?!
2119453818|00000000||Scared?
2119453820|00000000||Hah! Not a chance. You shall die here, bloede dh'oine!
2119453822|00000000||And you won't escape this time.

2119453833|00000000||Where am I?
2119453835|00000000||I should explore the surroundings.
2119453837|00000000||Nothing really interesting here.
2119453839|00000000||I should continue to follow this valley.
2119453841|00000000||This icy river is really slippery.
2119453843|00000000||Interesting these ice skates.
2119453845|00000000||And... there's like a mushroom smell on this loot.
2119453847|00000000||Even if it's less strong, this odour reminds me the fog's one that has paralyzed the witcher.
2119453849|00000000||I should follow it.
2119453851|00000000||Bear's odour covers that of mushrooms.
2119453853|00000000||A dead end. Yet there must be a passage.
2119453855|00000000||This wall is an illusion. I should be able to pass through it.

2119453899|00000000||Now it's time to return to Novigrad.

2119454236|00000000||But his condition is worsening as we speak, witcher. Can you please quickly fetch some medical herbs for a simple antitoxine for me? I will boil some water and observe him.
2119454238|00000000||They should be easy to find all around the hospital.
2119454240|00000000||What is it? Will he get better?
2119454242|00000000||I'm not sure. The effect was mitigated, yes, but I fear I'll have to be less conservative to save him.
2119454244|00000000||Do the procedure.
2119454246|00000000||Sounds like some conclusion.
2119454248|00000000||What kind of procedure is this?
2119454250|00000000||Tell me, what did you find?
2119454252|00000000||The universal antidote I applied just now, and all the other quick actions I could take, only addressed surface effects.
2119454254|00000000||The underlying problem is that our friend here is battling a strong paralytic poison that disrupts the conduction of nerve impulses.
2119454256|00000000||What kind of procedure are you suggesting?
2119454258|00000000||I will intubate his trachea. His upper airway is about to close due to spasms of the vocal muscles, which leads to suffocation.
2119454260|00000000||To prevent this, I will open his throat and insert a small tube so that air can still flow into his lungs in case he experiences cramps.
2119454262|00000000||Lean the patient's head back to expose his neck, this might take a little while...
2119454264|00000000||It is done. We have some time now.
2119454266|00000000||Master witcher, you told me about those elves before. We should track them down and find out who built that bomb.
2119454268|00000000||Agreed. Wherever they are, they will likely have an antidote or provide us with some clues about how to craft it.
2119454270|00000000||But you surely know that I can't take you with me. I will go, and you take care of our friend here.
2119454272|00000000||I expected you to say that. Well, it was just a fleeting thought anyway. Goodbye, Witcher. I hope to see you again.
2119454274|00000000||Godspeed.
2119454276|00000000||Do your procedure, then.
2119454278|00000000||Give it to me, hurry up!
2119454280|00000000||Alright, let's see... rub it between your hands, for three heartbeats in hot water and then ten beneath the nose... Hmm...
2119454282|00000000||I have to perform a dangerous procedure to give us some time, Ulvbjorn.
2119454284|00000000||Where am I?
2119454286|00000000||I should explore the surroundings.
2119454288|00000000||Nothing really interesting here.
2119454290|00000000||I should continue to follow this valley.
2119454292|00000000||This icy river is really slippery.
2119454294|00000000||Interesting these ice skates.
2119454296|00000000||And... there's like a smell on this loot.
2119454298|00000000||Even if it's less strong, this odour reminds me the fog's one that has paralyzed the witcher.
2119454300|00000000||I should follow it.
2119454302|00000000||Bear's odour covers that of mushrooms.
2119454304|00000000||A dead end. Yet there must be a passage.
2119454306|00000000||This wall is an illusion. I should be able to pass through it.
2119454308|00000000||The odour comes from this...
2119454310|00000000||Glowing mushrooms? Someone is growing them here.
2119454312|00000000||She underestimates witcher signs. Aard will help me get this door out.
2119454314|00000000||It's lucky for me that Geralt has a reputation among the elves.
2119454316|00000000||Last chance to give up.
2119454318|00000000||She was ruined by her overconfidence.
2119454320|00000000||I'm going to check out this redanian officer.
2119454322|00000000||After all, I deserve this reward.
2119454324|00000000||...well, you know everything now,  as quick as I could tell you.
2119454326|00000000||Do you see any chance for my fellow comrade?
2119454328|00000000||I don't know. We will have to see. I'll need the main bomb component to be sure..
2119454330|00000000||Given what you've described, it's probably a neurotoxin of mycelial origin.
2119454332|00000000||But his condition is worsening as we speak, witcher, can you please quickly fetch some medical herbs for a simple antitoxine for me? I will boil some water and observe him.
2119454334|00000000||They should be easily findable all around the house.
2119454336|00000000||You seem to have recovered sufficiently now.
2119454338|00000000||If you want to find the witcher who rescued you, I understand he went to meet the redanian officer who gave you the contract.
2119454340|00000000||Thanks.
2119454341|00000000||Ulvbjorn
2119454342|00000000||Ulvbjorn, a witcher from the Bear School, rescued Geralt from a bad situation, and went to the Novigrad hospital for help.<br>
2119454343|00000000||He managed to make a pact with the elven sorceress who held him captive, and obtained from her the ingredient needed to make the antidote.<br>
2119454344|00000000||He managed to escape, killed the elven sorceress holding him captive, and found the ingredient needed to make the antidote.<br>
2119454345|00000000||But the poor fool didn't respect the pact he'd made with the elven sorceress, and when he began to reveal her plans, he instantly burst into flames before the stunned eyes of the Redanian officer.<br>
2119454346|00000000||Ulvbjorn only partially revealed what was going on.<br>He took the meagre reward offered by the Redanian officer, and never appeared again.<br>
2119454347|00000000||Ulvbjorn revealed the elf sorceress's plans to the Redanian officer, and was rewarded handsomely.<br>Then he left, never to return.<br>
2119454348|00000000||Emilia
2119454349|00000000||What have you done?<br>I sealed our agreement.
2119454350|00000000||He began by retrieving the ingredients needed to temporarily stabilize Geralt's health, then continued his investigations until he found himself trapped in an elven laboratory.
2119454351|00000000||Ulvbjorn went to claim the reward from the Redanian officer who had given Geralt the contract.
2119454353|00000000||What have you done?
2119454355|00000000||I sealed our agreement. Don't try to tell anyone what you've learned here.
2119454357|00000000||Very well, you signed the oath.
2119454359|00000000||This is evident in the repeated spasms all over the body, as you can see. His vocal muscles are also contracting, which is why we have to perform the tracheostomy.
2119454361|00000000||But in the end, the body's muscles won't have any resource to keep this up. Then all the muscles will stop working, including the respiratory ones, such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.
2119454364|00000000||What is deadly, even for a witcher.
2119454366|00000000||Why did you call it dangerous?
2119454368|00000000||During the incision, I could damage the thyroid vessels, causing him to bleed out, or the recurrent nerve, which would result in him losing his voice.
2119454370|00000000||Although, as my teacher Von Gratz used to say, it's better to be mute than to be dead.
2119454374|00000000||Your body will remain here forever!
2119454375|00000000||I can't wait to dissect yout body!
2119454376|00000000||Die, witcher!
2119454377|00000000||I'll use your remains in my experiments!
2119454378|00000000||I'll kill you, vatt'ghern!
2119454380|00000000||One more thing before you go. Do you know who this witcher is?
2119454382|00000000||Sure. It's Geralt of Rivia.
2119454384|00000000||Absolutely not.
2119454386|00000000||Sure. It's Geralt of Rivia.
2119454388|00000000||Even though I'm from the Bear School, the famous White Wolf is no stranger to me.
2119454390|00000000||Very good. I was just wondering if you knew.
2119454392|00000000||Absolutely not. Someone from the Wolf School, I suppose?
2119454394|00000000||It's Geralt of Rivia, the famous White Wolf.
2119454396|00000000||He may be famous, but not among the Bear School.
2119454398|00000000||However, I'm going to do my best to find an antidote for him.

2119454408|00000000||Do you see any chance for my fellow comrade?
2119454410|00000000||I don't know. We'll have to see. I need the main bomb component to be sure..

2119454416|00000000||They should be easily findable all around the house.
2119454418|00000000||All right.
2119454420|00000000||Glad to see you again, witcher. I hope you've brought something new. Geralt's body is running low.
2119454422|00000000||Yeah, I found out something. But I made an oath that I wouldn't talk about it. Here's one dose of the antidote, but it's meant for an elf.
2119454424|00000000||An elf? And you have made an oath? Curious, witcher, I wish I had gone with you.
2119454426|00000000||But enough talking. I have to finalize the antidote quickly to make it suitable for a witcher's body.
2119454428|00000000||Yeah, it was the Scoia'tael who started it all. They were led by a sorceress named Emilia, who was creating a deadly poison from mushrooms.
2119454430|00000000||I'm not sure that's true, witcher. Do you have anything to prove your theory?
2119454432|00000000||Yes, a sample of the mushrooms she grew in the cave, along with her notes.
2119454434|00000000||Hmm... Elvish handwriting, no doubt. I didn't think they'd resort to such things, though.
2119454436|00000000||You obviously don't know the Scoia'tael well.
2119454438|00000000||Enough chatter. I must concentrate and synthesize an antidote based on the sample.
2119454440|00000000||I need time and silence, Ulvbjorn.
2119454442|00000000||Already disappearing.
2119454444|00000000||The antidote works! His muscle tone has returned to normal. He even regained consciousness for a short time. Now, he's just sleeping.
2119454446|00000000||Impressive result. It's an unknown poison. How did you figure out the proportions?
2119454448|00000000||Performed a series of complex calculations… Extrapolated some data… Made simulations…
2119454450|00000000||Meaning you guessed?
2119454452|00000000||Mhm. By the way, he thanked you for the rescue and said the reward for the contract is now yours.
2119454454|00000000||Go see the redanian officer on the temple island.
2119454456|00000000||I will. If we never meet again, tell him I wish good luck on his Path. And thank you for your help.
2119454463|00000000||I shouldn't go there. There are several elves to deal with.
2119454465|00000000||No time. I should check that witcher. Maybe he's still alive.
2119454467|00000000||While unconscious after an elf attack, Geralt was rescued by a witcher from the Bear School.<br>After providing the Novigrad doctor with the ingredients needed to stabilize Geralt, the witcher named Ulvbjorn set out to track down the elves in the hope of finding an antidote.<br>
2119454468|00000000||He finally found the portal that led him to the Blue Mountains, where he found himself the prisoner of an elven sorceress.<br>She was conducting experiments to develop a weapon for the Scoia'tael.<br>
2119454469|00000000||Ulvbjorn made a pact with the sorceress, and obtained a dose of antidote from her, which he promptly took to the doctor at Novigrad hospital.<br>
2119454470|00000000||Ulvbjorn managed to escape, and he defeated the sorceress.<br>Searching the laboratory, he found the main ingredient needed to make the antidote, which he took back to the doctor in Novigrad.<br>
2119454471|00000000||The witcher felt he deserved the reward promised by the original contract, and went to claim it from the Redanian officer.<br>But he did not respect the agreement he had made with the sorceress. Just as he was about to reveal the elves' intentions, he caught fire instantly and died.<br>
2119454472|00000000||The witcher felt he deserved the reward promised by the original contract, and went to claim it from the Redanian officer.<br>After collecting the reward, he left. No one knows what became of him.<br>
2119454475|00000000||I've got the antidote, but I can't elaborate.
2119454477|00000000||It's all about the Scoia'tael from the Blue Mountains.
2119454479|00000000||So long.
2119454481|00000000||Witcher?..
2119454483|00000000||I need to see the redanian officer on the temple island.
2119454485|00000000||I shouldn't go there. I need to see the redanian officer on the temple island.
2119454487|00000000||And watch out the guards. I suppose you have no pass. You might get into trouble.
2119454489|00000000||Snow, mountains, elves... Looks like Blue Mountains.
2119454491|00000000||Snow, mountains, elves... Looks like Blue Mountains.
2119454493|00000000||Snow, mountains, elves... Looks like Blue Mountains.
2119454495|00000000||What the hell is happening?
